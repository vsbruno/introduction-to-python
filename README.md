# Introduction to Python


üêç Why Python for AI?
Python stands as the lingua franca of AI and data science, thanks to its simplicity, versatility, and the vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks it offers. Whether you're an AI novice or looking to solidify your Python foundations, this course is designed with you in mind.

##PREREQUISITES

JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS
A great way to begin your training journey with Python is to utilize Jupyter Notebook.
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. Not only will you learn Python in this course but you will also take advantage of a very popular tool - Jupyter Notebook.

### CLOUD SERVICES
The quickest and easiest way to get started with Jupyter Notebook is to use a cloud-based Jupyter environment. These services provide a web-based interface for creating and running Jupyter Notebooks without requiring any installation or setup. Here are two recommendations but there are many others to choose from

### Google Colab
Google Colaboratory (also known as Colab) is an online platform that provides users with a Jupyter Notebook environment for writing and executing Python code. It allows users to access and run code from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. To use Colab, all you need is a Google account and a web browser. No additional software installation is required.
To get started with Google Colab [click on this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jckantor/CBE30338/blob/master/docs/01.01-Getting-Started-with-Python-and-Jupyter-Notebooks.ipynb) and read through the notebook.   
You can also get a quick [introduction to Colab here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj) 

### Try Jupyter
Jupyter.org‚Äôs Try Jupyter is an online platform that allows users to try out Jupyter Notebooks without needing to install anything on their local computer. This platform provides a web-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in the cloud, making it possible to access it from any device with internet access. Try Jupyter does not require any installation or setup, making it a quick and easy way to get started with Jupyter Notebooks.

### INSTALL  LOCALLY 
If you are more ambitious, you can install Python and Jupyter Notebooks on your computer or laptop.  You need to install Python and the Jupyter package. The easiest way to install these is through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which includes Python, Jupyter, and many other scientific computing libraries. You can download Anaconda from the official website [here and follow the installation instructions.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
